How to Avoid Cabin Fever in the age of COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------

### How do I intend to spend my time? How do I actually spend my time?

Motivation + primary questions of interest

COVID-19

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](./images/cute_puppy.png)

Create a “img” folder within your calendar-project repo and store the
image files there.

Data collection
===============

I collected data by . . .

1.  Creating two separate google calendars, one titled “Intended
    Schedule”, and one titled “Actual Schedule”.
2.  Logging the activity for my “intended schedule” for each day every
    morning when I woke up.
3.  Logging the activity for my “actual schedule” every time I finshed
    completing an activity.

I wrangled the data by . . .

1.  Importing the calendars as data frames from google calendar into
    RStudio
2.  Creating variables for length of time spent on activities, category
    of activity, etc.
3.  Assigning specific activities to broader categories for
    classification.

Results

And here are my results . . .
