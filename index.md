How to Avoid Cabin Fever in the age of COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------

### How do I intend to spend my time compared to how do I actually spend my time?

Motivation + primary questions of interest

blah blah blah

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](~/git/calendar-project/cute_puppy.png)

Create a “img” folder within your calendar-project repo and store the
image files there.

Data collection
===============

I collected data by . . .

1.  Creating two separate google calendars, one titled “Intended
    Schedule”, and one titled “Actual Schedule”.
2.  Logging the activity for my “intended schedule” for each day every
    morning when I woke up.
3.  Logging the activity for my “actual schedule” every time I finshed
    completing an activity.

Results

And here are my results . . .
