# You can include section headers like this

I can include an image (not created in R) like this:

![cute puppy](./img/cute_puppy.png)

# Data collection

I collected data by . . . 

I can write a bulleted list like this:

- here's the first thing I want to say
- and I also want to say this
- lastly, this

And a numbered list like this:

1. First thing
2. Second thing
3. Third thing

# Results

And here are my results . . .

```{r}
# intersperse relevant figures and text
```
